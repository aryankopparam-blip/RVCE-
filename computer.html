Coding is the process of writing instructions that a computer can understand and execute. It’s like giving life to ideas—whether you're building a website, creating a game, or automating tasks. Using languages like Python, JavaScript, or C++, coders solve problems, design systems, and bring digital experiences to life. At its core, coding is both logical and creative, blending structure with imagination to shape the technology we use every day.
